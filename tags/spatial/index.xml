      <description>Spatial extension of DuckDB In a previous tutorial we learned about DuckDB and how it can be used to query Parquet datasets from OBIS. As we shared, the new full export is a GeoParquet dataset, meaning that it add spatial functionalities to the standard Parquet format. DuckDB has a powerful spatial extension, which we will present in this tutorial. Of course, we will just give you a glimpse of what you can do with this extension, and you should invest a few minutes to explore the full documentation.</description>

      <description>duckplyr In the two previous tutorials we learned about how to use DuckDB for querying the Parquet exports and about the DuckDB spatial extension. Here we will explore the R package duckplyr, a drop-in replacement for DuckDB on R which uses the tidyverse grammar.
Again, we will work with a local copy of the full export, which you can download from here: https://obis.org/data/access/. You can also explore together through the Jupyter Notebook (download it locally or open it through Google Colab by clicking here).</description>
