    "In the two previous tutorials we learned about how to use DuckDB for querying the Parquet exports and about the DuckDB spatial extension. Here we will explore the R package [`duckplyr`](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/index.html), a drop-in replacement for DuckDB on R which uses the `tidyverse` grammar.\n",

    ">This will be a big download, around 16GB. If you are running it on Google Colab, use the compact version which is available on our GitHub. Just run the first cell below to download it.
