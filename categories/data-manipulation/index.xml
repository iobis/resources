      <title>Using DuckDB to query the OBIS full export - Part 1</title>

      <description>The OBIS full export OBIS has more than 160 million occurrence records available (and growing!). Previously you could download the full export as a single Parquet file and do a range of analysis with it, but since recently the full export became available in AWS through the Open Data Program. This came with a total update of the way the data is offered. Now the full export is offered as a dataset of GeoParquet files, what opens up a world of possibilities in doing spatial analysis with the data, and also make analysis much more efficient and cloud performant.</description>

      <title>Using DuckDB to query the OBIS full export - Part 2 (spatial extension)</title>

      <description>Spatial extension of DuckDB In a previous tutorial we learned about DuckDB and how it can be used to query Parquet datasets from OBIS. As we shared, the new full export is a GeoParquet dataset, meaning that it add spatial functionalities to the standard Parquet format. DuckDB has a powerful spatial extension, which we will present in this tutorial. Of course, we will just give you a glimpse of what you can do with this extension, and you should invest a few minutes to explore the full documentation.</description>

      <title>Using DuckDB to query the OBIS full export - Part 3 (`duckplyr` package)</title>

      <description>duckplyr In the two previous tutorials we learned about how to use DuckDB for querying the Parquet exports and about the DuckDB spatial extension. Here we will explore the R package duckplyr, a drop-in replacement for DuckDB on R which uses the tidyverse grammar.
Again, we will work with a local copy of the full export, which you can download from here: https://obis.org/data/access/. You can also explore together through the Jupyter Notebook (download it locally or open it through Google Colab by clicking here).</description>

      <title>Using the Parquet format with OBIS data</title>
      <link>http://www.example.com/tutorials/arrow-obis/</link>

      <description>What is Parquet? Parquet is a lightweight format designed for columnar storage. Its main difference when compared to other formats like csv is that Parquet is column-oriented (while csv is row-oriented). This means that Parquet is much more efficient for data accessing.To illustrate, consider the scenario of extracting data from a specific column in a CSV file. This operation entails reading through all rows across all columns. In contrast, Parquet enables selective access solely to the required column, minimizing unnecessary data retrieval.</description>
